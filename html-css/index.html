			Fairy
				Over hill, over dale,
				Thorough bush, thorough brier,
				Over park, over pale,
				Thorough flood, thorough fire,
				I do wander everywhere,
				Swifter than the moon's sphere;
				And I serve the fairy queen,
				To dew her orbs upon the green.
				The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
				In their gold coats spots you see;
				Those be rubies, fairy favours,
				In those freckles live their savours:
				I must go seek some dewdrops here
				And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
				Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
				Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
		</pre>

			PUCK
				The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
				Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
				For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
				Because that she as her attendant hath
				A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
				She never had so sweet a changeling;
				And jealous Oberon would have the child
				Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
				But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
				Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
				And now they never meet in grove or green,
				By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
				But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
				Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
